I am currently a first-year PhD track student in the Department of Computer Science at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), supervised by [Prof. Danica J. Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml). Before that, I received my Master and Bachelor degrees from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) in 2023 and 2020. 

My research interests span the areas of statistical machine learning and deep learning.
I am excited to delve into when and why the models and algorithms work (or do not work). 
And I hope to understand the remarkable successes and intriguing behaviors exhibited by these learning models better throughout my research journey.
