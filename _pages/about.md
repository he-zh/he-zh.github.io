I am a PhD track student at the Department of Computer Science at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), where I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Danica J. Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml). 
Currently, I am  visiting [Prof. Arthur Gretton](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/)'s group at [Gatsby Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit), University College London, working on kernel-based  statistical testing of conditional independence.
I received my Master degree in 2023 and Bachelor degree in 2020, from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn). 

My research interests span the areas of statistical machine learning and deep learning.
I am excited to delve into when and why the models and algorithms work (or do not work). 
And I hope to understand the remarkable successes and intriguing behaviors exhibited by these learning models better throughout my research journey.
