I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), advised by [Prof. Danica J. Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml). I previously completed my M.Sc. (2023) and B.Eng. (2020) at [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn).
In 2024, I was a visiting student at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/life-sciences/gatsby), collaborating with [Prof. Arthur Gretton](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/).

My research studies the statistical foundations of hypothesis testing. I develop principled methods for conditional independence testing, with a focus on understanding failure modes and providing robust guarantees in high-dimensional and online settings.

Broadly, I am interested in when and why learning algorithms succeed or break, and how to provide statistically grounded guarantees for complex models. I am increasingly exploring how conditional invariance principles can improve robustness and interpretability in neural networks.
