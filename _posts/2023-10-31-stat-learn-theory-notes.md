Hand-written notes taken during <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~dsuth/532D/23w1/">CPSC532D Statistical Learning Theory</a>.

The ultimate goal is to include key concepts, classical proofs and useful materials (e.g., commonly used inequalities) of learning theory course. 
However, the current version may not be very easy to read nor helpful ...
Will improve it continuously.
